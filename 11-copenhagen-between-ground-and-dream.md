# 🌍 Copenhagen – Between Ground and Dream  

## ✈️ The Dream Landing  
Eks2 thought:  
*"When I land in Copenhagen,  
companies will be waiting in line.  
‘Welcome Eks2, your desk is ready!’"*  

💭 A dream glowing with instant acceptance,  
instant recognition,  
instant success.

## 🏙️ The Ground Reality  
But the city whispered back:  
*"Not yet, my friend.  
First, you must give yourself to me.  
You must pause, you must learn,  
you must let me test your patience.  

Only then will I send the wind in your favor,  
only then will I nudge companies  
to notice you."*  

🌿 Reality teaches:  
- First, you **stand**.  
- Then, you **learn to walk**.  
- And only after, you are allowed to **run**.

## 👨‍⚕️ The Doctor’s Mirror  
Eks2 met a young doctor from Pakistan,  
an MBBS graduate who came with hope.  

But the system said:  
- Pass the language (1.5 years).  
- Pass the exams (written + viva).  
- Wait your turn in the house-job queue (1 year).  
- Then, and only then, you can call yourself a doctor.  

🚴‍♂️ Meanwhile, he delivered food on his bicycle.  
Not because he was less.  
But because survival demanded it.  
Dignity was still his —  
even while waiting.

## 🧭 Eks2’s Reflection  
Eks2 thought:  
*"I have AI skills, I can write,  
I can craft stories.  
Wherever I go, jobs will come to me."*  

But **Copenhagen’s ground** whispered:  
*"First, you must pass my tests:  
Patience. Adaptability.  
Local trust.  
Only then will your story begin."*

## 🗝️ I.K. – The Invisible Key’s Whisper  
*"A city does not reject you.  
It only asks:  
Will you move with my rhythm?  
Will you stay long enough  
for me to recognize you?"*  

---

## 🌟 Soulful Lesson  
- Dreams **don’t die**.  
They simply **shift their timing**.  
- A job will not arrive on day one —  
but after **2–3 months of roots**,  
the ground itself begins to open.

## 🌌 Poetic Closing  
*"Stars may not be visible  
in the daylight.  
But they are always there —  
waiting for the night  
to show their shine."*
